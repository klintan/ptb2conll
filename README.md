# Penn Tree bank tree parse format (Brackets format) to CoNLLX formatting.
Using the Stanford CoreNLP to convert PennTreeBank ( PTB ) to CoNLLx format. Haven't found a simple script for doing this.

The CorpusReader in NLTK is apparently also supporting this, but wanted to put this out there.

Requires:
Stanford CoreNLP
